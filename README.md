# Portfolio Website
Portfolio website is the first step a **Full Stack Developer** must create, so this is my Portfolio website :smiley:, here I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for creating 
this website. Currently this is the most basic website but with time I will change the components and add animation and more JavaScript. I will also use more framework in this \
websitem which will make it more interactive and convenient to understand.
